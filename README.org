** Why?
I wrote this for someone on Discord.
I know it's bad.

** [b6142de] citrus's changes:
Added a python file (standalone.py) that works without the sh file

** Usage
If you have shell access, you can use ~uwu.sh~, otherwise you can use ~standalone.py~.

- !A will make a protective, angry ÒwÓ,
- !E will make an enraged (Ò﹏Ó ╬)
- !H will make a happy ^_^
